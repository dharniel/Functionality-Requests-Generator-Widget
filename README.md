# Functionality-Requests-Generator-Widget

This widget was written in Google Scripts/JavaScript and HTML and CSS

The widget was created for use by the Clients Services Division at Foothold technology to automatically generate the 'Functionality Requests' from clients over the duration of a month. These requests were previously recorded separately in several google documents that were in several shared google folders on Google Drive and the widget aimed to parse the folders and files and organize the requests in a spreadsheet. 

The JavaScript code holds the bulk of methods for specific data computations and compilation and the HTML and CSS code is used to render the widget in a Google Sheets Spreadsheet.
