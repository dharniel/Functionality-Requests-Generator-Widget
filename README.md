# Functionality-Requests-Generator-Widget

This widget was written in Google Scripts/JavaScript and HTML and CSS

The widget was created to automatically generate the 'Functionality Requests' that had been recorded in several google documents that 
were in several shared google folders on Google Drive. 

The JavaScript code holds the bulk of methods for specific data computations and compilation and the HTML and CSS code is used to render 
the widget in a Google Sheets Spreadsheet.
